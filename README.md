# moenawark

Moenawark is a [play-by-post/play-by-internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game#Play-by-internet)
role playing game, in a space-opera settings.

Turns occurs every weeks, with moves resolution normally occuring saturday evening (UTC).

Emphasis is placed on roleplaying over game mechanics; more specifically, game mechanics should always support roleplaying.

It is a work in progress: code is not finished. In fact, code does nothing interesting yet :-) .
I'm developping it on my copious free time(tm), so expect rather slow progress...

Technically, it is written in Go and uses SQLite as datastore.
